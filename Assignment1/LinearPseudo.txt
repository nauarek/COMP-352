Algorithm for Linear implementation of Oddonacci

Algo (number){
Array A [3];
first =0;
second=0;
third=0;

if (number is 3){
    first,second, third = 1;
    set first three positions in A array to firs,second and third;
    return A;
} else{
    A = Algo(number-1);
    set first, second and third to A[0,1,2] respectively
    set A[0] to first+second+third
    set A[1] to first
    set A[2] to second
    return A;
}
