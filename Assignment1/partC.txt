Neither of the previous two algorithms use tail recursion, since tail recursion is when the last statement in a method contains a recursive call

A tail recursion method CAN be written for the same function, an example of one follows:

public static int tail(int k, int first, int second, int third){
        if(k==3){
            return third;
        }
        return tail(k-1, second,third, first+second+third);
    }

and when you call the tail, k is the number you'd like to find the oddonacci value for,
and first,second and third should be equal to 1
